# RULES: 
# category lists are sparse (meaning that they're not comprehensive), and are subjective.
# all the rest of these rules are just suggestions; none of this needs to be perfect in order to function.
# all nouns should be singular and nominative case (e.g. "I", not "me"). all verbs should be infinitive present-tense, without the word 'to' (e.g. "fly", not "to fly").
# 'negated' categories (e.g. 'not animal') are only allowed if they're exceptions to a rule. For example, "not fly" is allowed for "penguin" because bird has the property "fly"). They can also be allowed if they're stand-alone terms on their own (e.g. 'non-smoking' or 'inanimate'). Evlauating this is subjective.
# nested categories are NOT required. also, no category is required to link to a root category; free-floating branches are fine.
# terms can be longish sentence fragments, but ideally they will be words or short phrases. this maximizes pattern-recognition during reflection.

# STORED DATA:
#Each term can have the following data (see the database schema for more info)
	# a unique key
	# the term
	# "Part Of Speech" - For a complete list, see http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/
	# comprehensive definition (for now I am hard-coding these)
	# deduced definition
	# defining categories - the categories which define the object ontologically, and into which ALL instances can be classified. example: every time someone 'defines' something, they are 'describing' it.
	# other categories - categories into which ALL instances can be classified. for example: ALL instances of 'defining' are also 'stating'.
	# {various forms of the term, e.g. conjugation for verbs or plaurality for nouns or whatever}
			# 'Plaural': 	*defaults to the singular form plus 's'
			# 'PastTense':
			# 'PresentTense':
			# 'Gerund':
			# 'Actor':		*defaults to the gerund form minus "ing" plus "er".
			# 'Singular3rdPersonPerfectTense':
			# 'PerfectTense':
			# 'Pluperfect':
			# (and for the verb "be": 'PluralPastTense', 'PluralPresentTense', 'PluralInfinitive').
			# traditional response if one exists. these are common for some idioms.
		# 'Infinitive' is omitted because it's already included as the term.
		# 'FutureTense' is omitted because it's simply "will " + the infinitive.
	# miscellaneous data is stored in the table terms_misc
	# abstract ideas may have additional properties stored in the table terms_conceptType
